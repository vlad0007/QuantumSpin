<b>Online visualization Stern-Gerlach experiment, quantum spin, Bloch sphere, quantum rotations</b>

<b>In the first chapter</b> of this site,  an attempt was made to create a program containing a virtual  Stern-Gerlach experiment.

<b>The second and third chapters</b> deal with opposites and orthogonality in quantum mechanics, as well as double and half angles.

<b>The fourth chapter</b> provides a 3D-program that allows you to observe the rotations of an electron in physical and spinor spaces. 
At the same time,  you can see the corresponding values of the state vector of the quantum system.  
In a sense,  this program is similar to the Bloch sphere visualization program. However,  
in my opinion,  it more clearly demonstrates changes in the state vector when simultaneously visualizing electron rotations
in both physical and spinor spaces.

<b>The fifth chapter</b> deals with the Bloch sphere.  The corresponding interactive program is provided. 

<b>In the sixth chapter</b>,  using the program given in it,  you can see the visualization of three-dimensional rotations on the Bloch sphere.  
At the same time,  a fractional-linear transformation is carried out in the program and,  
as a consequence,  rotations are displayed not only on the sphere,  but also on the complex plane.  
Perhaps this is the most interesting program listed on this site.
Also in the program you can see the rotation of the Bloch vector,   
which is carried out using three Pauli matrices and the Hadamard matrix. 
Mathematical calculations used in the description of these rotations are given.
